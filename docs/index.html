      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Ternel. This is a collection library of functions aimed at simplifying your C# development. These include basic functions such as converting an data type, input validation, animations, etc. While many are already implemented into the language, such as using <i>LINQ</i>, convenient methods such as printing an array without having to initialize a for loop are not.</p>
      <p>We hope to expand this project to much more complex functions for different uses, such as in mathematics: Statistics, Probability, Calculus, etc.There are many broads concepts but the idea stands. </p>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>Suppose you are working with arrays. To assure your code is working, you need to see all the elements of your array first.</p>
      <p>This is very easy to achieve, though writing a function to do so in every program you make becomes annoying. To fix this, you might use one of our library's functions: </p>
      <div class="code-example">
        <h3>Use</h3>
        <div class="code-syntax">
          <p>int[] array = {10, 20, 30}; <br>
            Ternel.DisplayArr(array);
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Output may appear as so: </p>
        <div class="code-syntax">
          <p>
            > 10 <br>
            > 20 <br>
            > 30 <br>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>This library is in its beginning development stages, so code examples may vary.</p>
